# LearnFlow Desktop

This directory is the Tauri 2 shell for the existing React/Vite application.
It starts the packaged FastAPI sidecar on a random loopback port and generates
a fresh desktop token for every launch. The WebView has directory-picker
permission, but no broad filesystem permission; project file access is
validated again by the sidecar.

The browser keeps its HTTP-only cookie flow. Desktop login additionally uses
a bearer token returned only when the per-launch desktop token is valid; the
sidecar requires both tokens on subsequent bearer-authenticated requests.
The bearer is kept in WebView session storage and is discarded when the app
session ends.

## Local build

1. Install the backend dependencies and `desktop/requirements-build.txt`.
2. Install Rust and the Tauri 2 platform prerequisites.
3. Run `npm install` in `frontend/` and `desktop/`.
4. Run `npm run build:sidecar` in `desktop/`.
5. Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` in `desktop/`.

The generated target-triple sidecar and Rust/Node build output are ignored by
Git. macOS signing, Windows signing, and store credentials are intentionally
outside this repository stage.

## macOS one-click app

After `npm run build` finishes on Apple Silicon, install the real Tauri app and
create a Desktop icon with:

```bash
cd desktop
bash scripts/install_macos_app.sh
```

The script installs `LearnFlow.app` into `~/Applications`, creates
`~/Desktop/LearnFlow.app` as a clickable entry, and launches the app. The app
starts its bundled FastAPI sidecar on a random loopback port; it does not open
the browser-based `start.sh` workflow. Existing app entries are moved to a
timestamped `.backup-*` path instead of being deleted.

On macOS, the default desktop pet shortcut is `Command+Option+P`. It is
registered through the cross-platform Tauri shortcut service and can be
changed in the pet settings. When the pet is visible, the shortcut opens the
macOS interactive region capture; the selected PNG is kept in a randomly
named temporary file only for the duration of the capture, then sent through
the existing account vision provider and removed. macOS may ask for Screen
Recording permission the first time this is used. If permission is denied,
the normal image attachment flow remains available.

## Internal packages

`.github/workflows/desktop-internal.yml` builds unsigned macOS and Windows
packages on GitHub-hosted runners and uploads each `bundle/` directory as a
workflow artifact. It first runs the workspace/Tutor/registry contract tests,
then the frontend build, PyInstaller sidecar build, and Tauri build. Run the
workflow manually for release candidates; direct pushes to `main` or `codex/**`
that touch desktop, backend, or frontend code also exercise the same matrix.
